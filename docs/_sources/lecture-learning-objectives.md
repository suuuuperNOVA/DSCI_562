# Lecture Learning Objectives

## Lecture 1 - Beyond Ordinary Least-Squares!
- Identify cases where ordinary linear regression is not suitable.
- Recall the basics of ordinary linear regression.
- Distinguish what makes a regression model "*linear*".
- Approach datasets where the response's range is restricted.
- Explore the concept of the link function.

## Lecture 2 - Foundations of Generalized Linear Models: Binary Logistic and Count Regressions
- Explain the concept of generalized linear models (GLMs).
- Differentiate a GLM from an ordinary linear regression model.
- Build up four fundamental GLMs: binary logistic, Poisson, quasi-Poisson, and negative binomial.
- Perform model selection in GLMs through Analysis of Deviance.
